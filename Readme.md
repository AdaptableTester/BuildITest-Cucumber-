# Build IT Test

 There are two source folder
 
 1) src/main/java
 It has config,testcases(Stepfile),Util package
 Under the testcase package ,there is runner class created(BuildITRunner).That is used to run all the testcases.
 Here I have not implemeted the project with Maven but can do in real project and will run the project with pom.xml.
 
 2) src/test/resources
 It has testacse(Featurefile)package
 
 
 3) I will also include the jars file.Add jars files as 'Add External JARs'
 First install all the jars files in 'cucumberjar' folder then install the jars files in 'jars' folder.Please get back to me in case I have missed any Jar files.

4) The project is running OK.
